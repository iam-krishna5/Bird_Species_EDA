Bird Species Observation Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the distribution and diversity of bird species in distinct ecosystems, namely forests and grasslands. The primary goal is to understand how environmental factors—such as vegetation type, climate, and terrain—influence bird populations and their behaviors. By analyzing provided observational data, the project aims to identify patterns of habitat preference and provide valuable insights for habitat conservation, biodiversity management, and ecological policy support.




Key Features and Analysis
The project includes a comprehensive data analysis and visualization pipeline:


Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: The process involves handling missing values, standardizing data, and consolidating data from multiple Excel sheets representing different administrative units.




Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The analysis studies species distribution, observation frequency over time (temporal analysis), and the relationships between environmental conditions and bird activity.


Species and Behavioral Analysis: The project includes an analysis of species diversity metrics, activity patterns, and the impact of environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and wind.



Observer Trends: The analysis also assesses potential observer bias and the effect of repeated visits on species counts.


Interactive Dashboard: An interactive Streamlit dashboard is created to visualize key findings with dynamic charts and filters.



Technical Stack
Python: The core programming language for the project.

pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.

seaborn & matplotlib: Used for creating statistical and interactive data visualizations.

Streamlit: The framework used to build the interactive web dashboard.

Data
The project uses the "Bird_Observation_DataSet". This dataset contains observational data for bird species recorded across various forest sites. The data is spread across multiple sheets within a single Excel file, with each sheet containing specific data for an administrative unit (e.g., ANTI, CATO, CHOH). The dataset includes columns with information on location, observation methods, bird species, and environmental conditions.




Project Deliverables

Cleaned Dataset: A final preprocessed dataset ready for analysis.


Source Code: A single Python script (dashboard.py) containing all the code for data processing and visualization.


Interactive Dashboard: A Streamlit web application that showcases key insights with filters and charts.


Documentation: A final report explaining the approach, key findings, and actionable insights.

How to Run the Project
To run the interactive Streamlit dashboard, follow these steps:

Ensure all required packages are installed. The key libraries are pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and streamlit. You can install them by running:

Bash

pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib streamlit
Place the data files (Bird_Monitoring_Data_FOREST.XLSX and Bird_Monitoring_Data_GRASSLAND.XLSX) and your dashboard.py script in the same directory.

Open your terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

Execute the dashboard with the following command:

Bash

streamlit run dashboard.py
This will launch the application in your web browser, where you can interact with the visualizations.
