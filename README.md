# Bird Species Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project analyzes bird monitoring data collected from Forest and Grassland habitats. The goal is to explore bird species observations, environmental factors, and seasonal patterns using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries.

---

## Dataset

- **Bird Monitoring Data - Forest:** Excel file containing multiple sheets with bird observation data from forest habitats.
- **Bird Monitoring Data - Grassland:** Excel file containing multiple sheets with bird observation data from grassland habitats.
- **Merged Cleaned Dataset:** Combined and cleaned CSV file merging forest and grassland data.

---

## Project Overview

- Data cleaning and preprocessing including handling missing values, standardizing column names, and adding seasonal information.
- Combining multiple sheets and datasets into a unified DataFrame.
- Exploratory Data Analysis with various visualizations to understand species distribution, environmental conditions, observer contributions, and seasonal trends.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (`Bird_monitoring.ipynb`)
